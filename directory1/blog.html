                    <h3>MOTTO: INTEGRITY & EXCELLENCE</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        "St. Martin Le Finn Academy is a low-cost community school, located along Kimwanga- Mayanja road, 3KM from Kimwanga market and about 4KM from Chwele-Malakisi junction at Mayanja market, in Kimaeti Sub-County, Bungoma County. 

                        The school is located in a serene neighborhood, conducive for learners, and interactive with the community.
                        
                        The school was started in 2018, as a low-cost community school targeting low-income families and underprivileged, as well as orphaned children to access quality education, and has grown over time as it currently has a population of about 150 pupils with a staff of 12, all with experience of handling and nurturing pupils with uttermost care and stewardship. The school started from baby class up to class 4 initially and as a day school sponsoring majority of the pupils. Later on, facilities were put up to cater for class 5 to 8 pupils, since they required a lot of teacher-pupil contact hours. It is a Christian school in faith and this is the foundation of its morals. Our core values are guided by the principle of integrity and Excellence, on that foundation, we nurture our learners into disciplined, upstanding future leaders. The school is situated on an expansive land within the rural communities, that provides sufficient space for children to learn, be nurtured, play, and grow holistically. The school is registered with the Ministry of Education.
                        
                        At St. Martin Le Finn, we grow and nurture talent through established activities, as learners participate in Sports, Drama, Music, and Debating. They engage in a lot of outside sports competitions to build their skills, as the children are offered the opportunity to access limited learning resources equally.
                        
                        At St. Martin Le Finn Community Academy, we offer the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC) model of education from play-group through Pre-primary (PP) 1 & 2, and Grades 1 to 6, and also Junior Secondary Grade7, and 8."
